    "In my assignment for sentiment analysis I chose two subreddits to compare overall sentiment for posters. Sentiment anaylsis is the process of assigning words a positive or negative value and then analyzing sentences (in this case comments and posts) for their overall sentiment score. This GENERALLY can be an indicator for how positive or negative the post (and the feelings of the poster) are. We were able to scrape for data from reddit by having credentials through creating an API on the site. The two (WHICH FOR CLARITY I DECIDED ON BEFORE FINISHING THROUGH TEH WALKTHROUGH VIDEO) were Republican and Democrats. My hunch was that there would be some drastic differences over the last month in positivity due to the recent inauguration (and literally everything else going on). My hunch was wrong. We need to normalize the results because if we were looking at sheer numbers it just isn't equitable. Much like judging crime rates on a small town vs a big city we need to view them \"per capita\" in order to get a clear picture of the rate of crime vs the literal numbers of crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "While there is minor evidence showing the Democrats reddit has high positivity scores from 2-5 and the Republican subreddit has higher negativity from -1 to -4. There are a few outliers but my hunch was that there was going to be a massive difference between the two (given Georgia Senate results as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few ways I want to explain this is that 1) before normalization there was a drastic difference between total sentiment scores and comments....I tried to pick two with similar total members but that does not necessarily correlate to the activity of subreddit. Secondly, While there are macro reasons that someone could think one party should be experience more positive sentiments there are still daily events that can affect that. Or, it's entirely possible that republicans arent as upset that trump is leaving as i would have thought. (I originally wanted to go with a trump vs biden subreddit but biden is virtually non-existent and the trump subreddit is private {and thus gave me a http 403 error when trying to scrape} and i couldnt bring myself to ask to join) \n",
